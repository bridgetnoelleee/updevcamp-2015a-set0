				<i>One of the most random thoughts I have always had as a child, though not the brightest one, was my funeral. I wondered who will exert their time and effort to come and mourn for my death, what will be the color of my casket or the design of my jar if ever I will be cremated, and will the people ever be satisfied with coffee and Zesto with crackers on side.</i>

				<br><br>Little did I know that these were stepping stones for me to ponder on thoughts that matter more. At my wake, what will be the content of the eulogies that will be shared by my family, friends and colleagues? Or to put it in a way that would inspire and motivate me: what do I want to be the content of their eulogies?</p>
